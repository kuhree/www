## Updates

### ChatGPT and other LLMs and "AI"

I've integrated ChatGPT and other models into my weekly life at this point. [Arc Browser](arc-browser) has definitely contributed to this change with their [MAX](arc-max) features and [Arc Search](arc-search).

### Moving

We've moved back to Georgia! It feels good to be home and there's so much I missed that we haven't been able to find anywhere else.

### Work

I've found a new job doing [Software Support](/work/software-support). It's been great to utilize my skills with a faster pace and lower responsibilities. Providing customer satisfaction has always been a key thing to me. In my role, I get to sit in the middle of all the different effort from engineering+, marketing, leadership and observe how it affects our customers and their experience. It's been one hell of a learning experience so far.

### Gaming

I've recently gotten back into the COD cycle after about a 8 year hiatus. It's been fun, the gunplay is cool, Warzone is crazy, and the friends are having fun.

Of course, I'm still hard-stuck Champion in Rocket League. That game will probably die before I ever get out.

We've been grinding [It Takes Two](it-takes-two) for a couple weekends so I'm looking out for what's next.

Some other games I'm personally watching out for:

- [Helldivers 2](helldivers-2)
- [Hell Let Loose](hell-let-loose)
- [Palworld](palworld)

## Overall

I'm doing well, 2022/2023 was a rough couple of years. Now, I'm feeling more hopeful than ever and ready to get life back on track.
