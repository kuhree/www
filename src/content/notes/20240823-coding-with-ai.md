## Intro

I've always been a fan out automation, of robots, of technology "enhancing the human experience." As of late, the world has been experiencing another "AI" boom. This time feels a bit different than the chatbots of yesteryear, but how practical are they in my day-to-day life and work? 

For the past month or so, I've tried to see just how much I can get done using AI. Of course, in my typical fashion, everything is run locally, but could easily be extended by cloud providers in a production environment.

Here are my findings.

### How to run LLMs locally.

- Servers: ollama (preferred), LmStudio, LocalAI
- Clients: Open-WebUI/LibreChat/SillyTavern

## Usecases

## Life

### Responding to emails

### Drafting content

### Enhanced Journaling

## Work

### Code Generation

### Coding Assistant

### Image generation

## Conclusion
